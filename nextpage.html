        In close cooperation with the scholarly department of the Schloß
        Schönbrunn Kultur- und Betriebsgesellschaft (SKB), this project surveys
        all relevant extant visual and textual sources on the architectural
        development of the palace complex and the functional history of
        Schönbrunn from the late seventeenth century to the present day in order
        to produce a scholarly publication on the Habsburg summer residence
        beyond the gates of Vienna (ed. by Elfriede Iby and Anna Mader-Kratky).
        Extensive pilot studies by the scholarly department of the SKB serve as
        an important basis for further research: following a survey of the
        extant material, further relevant sources are now being established and
        assessed. The materials are reproduced on the basis of the historical
        sources; particular attention is paid to finds from excavations and
        restoration work conducted under the aegis of the SKB since the 1990s.
        The planned publication on the architectural and functional history of
        Schönbrunn Palace ranges from the late seventeenth century to the
        present day. It begins with the palace’s construction as a hunting and
        summer residence with corresponding gardens in the 1690s, examining the
        role of space and ceremony and the palace’s first furnishings and
        decorations, only few of which have survived. Courtyard facade of

        the generous expansion of Schönbrunn Palace as Maria Theresa’s summer
        residence, which took place in two phases of construction and furnishing
        (1743–1749 and 1754–1765). The palace’s interior underwent exquisite
        ornamentation (the Great and the Small Galeries, the Vieux Laque Room,
        the East Asian Cabinets etc.), and the Palace Park also formed part of
        the project. The development of elaborate park buildings and an
        extensive programme of statues in the 1770s can be considered the final
        testing ground for Habsburg representation in the Baroque style. After
        Maria Theresa’s death (1780), the palace remained largely uninhabited
        until Emperor Francis II/I chose it as his summer residence in the early
        nineteenth century and initiated reconstruction work in the late 1810s.
        Court architect Johann Aman suggested redesigning it in the contemporary
        Classicist style, which included undoing the Rococo façade decoration;
        the painting of the façades in what would later become known as
        “Schönbrunn yellow” also seems to date back to this phase. In the course
        of the nineteenth century, the interior continued to be decorated and
        modernised in the style of the day in order to meet the standards of
        residential comfort. With the end of the monarchy in 1919, the question
        arose as to how to use the extensive palace complex. In future, it would
        serve as a museum and a home to various institutions and private Lorem
